Description: Path Traversal & Local File Inclusion (LFI) Vulnerability

Overview

Path Traversal and Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities arise when an application improperly processes user-supplied input to access system files. This can lead to unauthorized access, information disclosure, or even remote code execution in some cases.

Path Traversal

Path Traversal occurs when an attacker manipulates file paths using sequences like ../ (dot-dot-slash) to navigate directories and access restricted files. If an application improperly constructs file paths, attackers can retrieve sensitive data such as:

System configuration files (/etc/passwd, C:\windows\system.ini)
Application source code
Log files containing credentials or tokens
     Severity: High

Steps to Reproduce :

1. First obsove the parmater in burp proxy histry Open the following URL in a browser

2.  Observe that system file content is exposed

3.  Capture the request into the burp to add page load to see the response and repeater

4.  It was exploit to give information in local file inclusion scene in Render

5. Then right click to view to response in the browser option selected and seeing the response it was exploit

Payload: %252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd

 

Impact:

- Attackers can read sensitive files.

- Possible RCE if PHP files are included.

 

Recommended Fixes:

- Validate and whitelist file names.

- Use `realpath()` to ensure files are within an allowed directory.

- Restrict file permissions.
